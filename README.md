# supply-chain-sql-project
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project simulates a supply chain database for a sports retailer and uses SQL to analyze inventory levels, restocking needs, and supplier performance.

I used this project to learn and apply key SQL concepts like:
- Table creation and relationships (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY)
- Joins and aggregations
- CASE statements and calculations
- Filtering and conditional logic

## ðŸ§± Database Schema
- `Products`: Stores product info
- `Inventory`: Tracks stock levels and restock thresholds
- `Suppliers`: Supplier directory
- `Restocks`: Delivery history per supplier
- `Orders` & `Order_Details`: Track customer purchases

## ðŸ§ª Sample Analysis Queries
- Products that need restocking
- Top-selling items by quantity and revenue
- Overstocked items (slow movers)
- Average delivery time by supplier
- Monthly revenue trends
